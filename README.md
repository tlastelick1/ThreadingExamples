proj2a.c, Proj2aDataChart
Computes PI with different numbers of threads and logs the accuracy into a chart.

proj2b.c
Asks the user for a number then computes the fibonacci sequence on it and returns the value.

proj2c.c 
Asks the user for a word and determines whether each letter in the word is a vowel or consonate.
